Print Tracker currently supports integrating with Supplies Network for automatic supply auto-fulfillment. All auto-fulfillment configuration is managed through Supplies Network, Print Tracker only allows you to either enable or disable the integration. When enabled, meter reads are sent to Supplies Network daily for predictive analysis. 

## Who are you?
### Dealer
Dealers that are setting up a Supplies Network integration for the first time should reach out to Supplies Network and Print Tracker to setup the integration for their dealership.

Assuming that a Supplies Network integration has already been setup by your dealer, you can enable this integration at any entity or even for specific devices.
