The web-admin provides a globally-accessible portal to your device fleet, and the data collection agents that are responsible for collecting your device's meter and consumable data. It provides a simple interface for configuring settings such as:

- How often should meters be collected?
- At which level should consumable alerts be fired?
- Where should consumable alert emails be sent?

In addition to settings configuration, the web-admin also gives you access to device-specific tools such as:

- Remote Technician.
- Supply burn-down over time analysis.
- Meter volume over time broken down by meter type.

The web-admin also allows you to hierarchically manage your customers, field technicians, and top-level fleet managers in whatever organizational method makes the most sense for your company.
