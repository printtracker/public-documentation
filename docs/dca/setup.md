In order to use Print Tracker to collect data from printer devices, you must install a data collection agent (referred to as an "install" in Print Tracker) that has network access to the printer devices. The following step-by-step will help you install and register a data collection agent. Installs must be registered to an [entity](../webadmin/concepts/entities-users-and-installs.md).

1. Log-on to Print Tracker Pro Admin user interface from [https://www.app.printtrackerpro.com/auth/login](https://www.app.printtrackerpro.com/auth/login).
2. Click on the list box drop-down arrow next to your dealer entity name. 
3. Search to see if your customer has an entity record by entering the customer’s name in the ‘Search Entities’ input box.
4. Press the ‘Search’ button (an alternative is to search through the list).
