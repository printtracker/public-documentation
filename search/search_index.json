This translates to:</p> \\[\\begin{align} 255\\ IP\\ addresses \\times (1s\\ timeout \\times 3\\ retries) \\times (1\\ ping\\ +\\ 1\\ snmp) \\\\  = 1,530\\ seconds \\\\  = 25.5\\ minutes \\end{align}\\] <p>Note</p> <p>These numbers are the \"worst case\" scenario.

Print Tracker Pro checks in with the server about every 5 minutes allowing for a relatively quick time frame for new settings and instructions to be picked up by the DCA. While this solution is adequate for most needs, it takes a significant amount of time to troubleshoot, make remote changes, and update settings. In the past, solutions were presented to accomplish a more real-time connection between DCAs and remote servers by maintaining open ports where the two parties could push and pull data between each other.

HTTP/2 does not modify the application semantics of HTTP in any way. All core concepts, such as HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain in place. Instead, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is framed (formatted) and transported between the client and server, both of which manage the entire process, and hides all the complexity from applications within the new framing layer.</p> <p>The current paradigm that has driven DCA development to this point is the standard client to server request and response mechanism: a client makes a single request, a server responds with a single response. A powerful new feature of HTTP/2 is the ability of the server to send multiple responses for a single client request. That is, in addition to the response to the original request, the server can push additional resources to the client, without the client having to request each one explicitly. This abstraction allows for what we call server push.</p>"},{"location":"dca/whitepaper/#security","title":"Security","text":"<p>The ability for a remote party to push data and trigger remote actions can seem like a massive security vulnerability at first sight, however, there are several security mechanisms that minimize the risk to the same level as the risks that standard HTTP present. Under the hood, clients in an HTTP/2 stream always have the option to decline information pushed from a server, however, in a scenario where the remote server is a trusted party, there is usually no reason for a client to deny remote information.</p> <p>In a web browser, malicious attacks are prevented by preventing the remote execution of code based on the origin of the server that is providing it. Print Tracker Pro uses a similar concept where both the DCA and the server engage in a mutual TLS handshake when a DCA is registered. This handshake ensures communication can now only be done between that specific instance of a DCA, and the specific remote server with which the DCA requested a handshake. This prevents malicious third-party attacks because they were neither the requesting DCA nor the remote server.</p>"},{"location":"dca/whitepaper/#restricted-scope-of-actions","title":"Restricted scope of actions","text":"<p>Every DCA has a predefined set of abilities which can be remotely triggered, these abilities include (but are not limited to) updating local DCA settings, scanning the local network for devices that respond on port 161 (SNMP), etc. This is identical to how current DCA technology works, where a DCA will receive instructions to perform a specific task and will then execute that task based on predetermined logic that was installed with the DCA.
